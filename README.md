## Libraries

- Jetpack Compose : used for the ui and state management
- Dagger-Hilt : a library for  dependency injection in Android apps that works seamlessly with Compose.
- Accompanist: Used as a paging library for horizontal paging of composable

## Design & Features

The app has two screens namely the SearchCountryScreen which is the first screen that offers a list of grouped countries, clicking on a country item navigates to the  CountryDetailsScreen that shows details concerning selected country

The design is from [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/v9AXj4VZNnx26fTthrPbhX/Explore)

## Features to be added

- Theming: Improve on the theming to make the mode change cleaner
- List Filtering: Add the functions to filter the list by continent and time zone
- Search Feature: Add function for the country list search feature

## Challenges

- Designing the DTO model: This took too much time since a number of the elements are nullable and the JSON is quite large. A bit of debugging and analysing the JSON file did the trick
